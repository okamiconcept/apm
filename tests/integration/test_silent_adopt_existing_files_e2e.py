"""End-to-end regression: silent adopt of byte-identical pre-existing files.

Reproduces the catch-22 reported by zava-storefront where:
  1. A project's apm.lock loses ``deployed_files`` for non-skill packages
     (e.g. lockfile wiped, hand-edited, partial install crash, regenerated
     by an older APM build).
  2. The deployed files are still on disk, byte-identical to the
     package's source.
  3. Re-installing on stock 0.13.0 silently treats those files as
     "user-authored", skips them, and writes an empty ``deployed_files``
     back to the lockfile.
  4. The next install with ``required-packages-deployed`` enforced is
     permanently blocked because the policy gate runs *before* integrate
     in ``pipeline.py`` -- there's no path to self-heal.

Post-fix, step 3 silently *adopts* the existing files (their bytes match
the package source) and repopulates ``deployed_files`` -- breaking the
catch-22.

Requires network access and GITHUB_TOKEN/GITHUB_APM_PAT for GitHub API.
