"""Target-scoped manifest reconciliation shared by lockfile build sites.

On-disk stale cleanup is target-scoped: it preserves files belonging to
OTHER deploy targets (``phases/cleanup.py``). The lockfile manifest must
reconcile with the same symmetry. An ``apm install`` only governs its own
targets' deploy roots and URI schemes, so manifest entries written by a
prior install for OTHER targets must be PRESERVED rather than clobbered.

Without this symmetry a multi-target deploy (e.g. the ``copilot`` target
writing ``.github/`` + ``.agents/skills/`` files, then a later
``copilot-app`` install writing DB-URI rows) leaves the committed lockfile
single-target: the surviving on-disk files become orphaned from the
manifest and escape every manifest-driven audit gate -- deployed-files-
present, content-integrity, and drift (issue #1716).

Two manifest blocks need this reconciliation:

* per-dependency ``deployed_files`` / ``deployed_file_hashes``
  (``phases/lockfile.py``), and
* project-root ``local_deployed_files`` / ``local_deployed_file_hashes``
  (``phases/post_deps_local.py``).

Both import :func:`union_preserving` so the behaviour stays identical.
